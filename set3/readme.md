Need to figure out the logic behind range without using range for exercise 1 loop_ranger
start = start of the range; stop = end of the range; step = value of increase

Exercise 1:
stubborn_asker exercise
--> create a message that isn't in the loop (so it doesn't repeat all the time)
--> while loop is a conditional loop that continues executing the loop until the condition is true (usually a UI thing - requires user input)
--> need to convert the input values and message as an integer (int)
--> create true false conditions with if and else to print messages

not_number_rejector exercise
--> try / except block

super_asker exercise
-->try / except block
--> under try run stubborn_asker

Exercise 2:

Exercise 3:

Exercise 4:
--> Makes use of Exercise 2
--> while loop condition needs to be low < high:
--> Need tries += 1 for each if/elif/else so it can count each try
-->
